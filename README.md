# gc-companion

A structured project repository and coordination companion for residential owner-builders and independent general contractors.

gc-companion uses agentic AI to help builders track dependencies, organize project information, and surface schedule risk—while keeping the human in control.

## What It Does

- Maintains a structured, versioned project repository  
- Tracks schedule dependencies and critical path changes  
- Organizes inspections, emails, and project documentation  
- Surfaces coordination gaps and emerging risks  

GC Companion is designed to reduce cognitive load on complex builds without replacing builder judgment.
